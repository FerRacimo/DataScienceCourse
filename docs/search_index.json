There is a whole world of R functions we can use to sample random values from probability distributions or obtain probabilities from them! The _pois family of functions allow us to work with Poisson distributions, while the _geom family of functions allow us to work with Geometric distributions. Be careful with which type of function you use! For example, rpois serves to generate random samples from the Poisson distribution. In turn, dpois allow us to calculate the Poisson PMF (in other words, \\(P[X=k]\\)) for any value of k. Finally, ppois allow us to calculate the “distribution function,” which is just a fancy way of saying \\(P[X \\leq k]\\) for any value of k. After having navigated these help pages, let’s take a stab at answering some discrete probability questions: Excercise: Let’s assume the number of meteorites hitting a planet follows a Poisson distribution. If meteorites hit the planet at a rate of 5 per year, what is the probability that 3 or less meteorites will hit on a given year? Exercise: Assuming the same rate as above, what is the probability that more than 10 meteorites hit on a given year? Exercise: Each hour, 3 buses arrive at a station on average. Simulate a thousand 1-hour instances of this random process, assuming the number of buses per hour follows a Poisson distribution. Compute their sample mean and variance. Exercise: If I’m tossing a series of unbiased coins, what is the probability I get exactly 5 tails before I get a head? Exercise: If I’m tossing a series of unbiased coins, what is the probability I get at least 5 tails before I get a head? Finally, we can use the function sample() to simulate from a discrete uniform distribution. As input, this requires a vector containing the possible values that we can sample from (for example, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in a six-sided dice), and the number of trials we want to perform. Make sure to set the option replace to TRUE, so that we can sample with replacement from the specified vector. Exercise: Using the sample() function, throw a fair 16-sided dice a thousand times and compute the sample mean of your results. 5.2 The Normal distribuiton and the Central Limit Theorem The Central Limit Theorem states that if \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) are random samples from a distribution (any distribution) with mean \\(\\mu\\) and finite variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), and the sample mean is \\(\\bar{X}\\), then, as n grows large, \\(\\bar{X}\\) converges in distribution to a Normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2 / \\sqrt{n}\\). In other words, for large values of n (large sample sizes), we can treat the average of our sample as being drawn from \\(N(\\mu,\\sigma^2/\\sqrt{n})\\). How can we verify this to be true? 5.3 Other continuous distributions "]]
